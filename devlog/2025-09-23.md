# Development Log - 2025-09-23

## Accomplishments

This development session focused on scaffolding and integrating a new React dashboard application with a GCP backend, based on the detailed instructions in `gemini.md` and `gemini2.md`.

### Frontend (React Application)

- **Project Scaffolding:** A new React application (`dashboard-app`) was created using Vite.
- **Dependencies:** All necessary dependencies were installed, including React Router, Firebase, Recharts, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS was configured, including the creation of `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`, and the inclusion of Tailwind directives in `index.css`.
- **Component Structure:** The application was structured with a clear component hierarchy as specified in the project plan.
- **Routing:** React Router was implemented to create routes for the Login, Sign Up, Dashboard, and Data Sources pages.
- **Firebase Authentication:**
    - An `AuthContext` was created to manage the user's authentication state throughout the application.
    - The `Login` component was built with a UI for email/password and Google Sign-In.
    - Protected routes were implemented to restrict access to authenticated users.
- **Data Sources Page:** The page was updated to dynamically generate the Constant Contact OAuth URL, embedding the user's Firebase UID for tracking.
- **Dashboard:** The dashboard was connected to the backend, with logic to fetch and display data, including loading and error states.

### Backend (Google Cloud Function)

- **API Endpoint:** A new HTTP-triggered Google Cloud Function (`get-dashboard-data`) was created in Python.
- **Security:** The function is secured by requiring a Firebase ID token in the `Authorization` header.
- **Data Logic:** The function queries a BigQuery database to retrieve data specific to the authenticated user.

## Outstanding Items

The application is now fully scaffolded but requires the following configuration to be fully operational:

1.  **Firebase Configuration:** The placeholder values in `dashboard-app/src/utils/firebase.js` must be replaced with a valid Firebase project configuration.
2.  **Cloud Function Deployment:** The `get-dashboard-data` function located in the `cloud_functions/api/get-dashboard-data` directory needs to be deployed to a GCP project.
3.  **API Endpoint URL:** The placeholder API URL in `dashboard-app/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx` must be updated with the URL of the deployed Cloud Function.
